Reporting Problems or Issues
============================

If you experience issues with building or using AREDN速 devices, there are several sources of help. There is an active user community that regularly contributes to the AREDN速 `Forum <https://www.arednmesh.org/forum>`_, and you can post your experience there to receive help and feedback.

However, if you have issues that you think should be investigated by the AREDN速 development team, you can follow the steps below for engaging with the software developers.

Download a Support Data File
    Every node has a built-in tool that allows you to download a support data file containing information that is helpful for troubleshooting. To download a support data file from your node, login as your node *admin* and click the tools icon in the left nav bar. In the list of available tools, click the **Support Data** link and the support file will be downloaded to your computer.

Create a GitHub account
  To open an issue on GitHub you first must create your own GitHub account. This is free and easy to do by following these steps:

  1. Open your web browser and navigate to the `GitHub URL <https://github.com>`_.
  2. Click the ``Sign Up`` button and enter the required information. We suggest using your callsign as the username.
  3. On the GitHub website, click the ``Sign In`` button and authenticate to GitHub with the credentials you created.
  4. Navigate on GitHub to the AREDN速 code repository: ``https://github.com/aredn/aredn``
